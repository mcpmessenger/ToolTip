# AWS Amplify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready for Deployment!

Your project is now configured for AWS Amplify deployment. Here's what has been set up:

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

1. **`amplify.yml`** - Amplify build configuration
2. **`build.ps1`** - PowerShell build script (Windows)
3. **`build.sh`** - Bash build script (Linux/Mac)
4. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Detailed deployment documentation
5. **`dist/server.js`** - Combined server entry point
6. **Updated `package.json`** - Added build scripts and backend dependencies

### 🚀 Deployment Steps

#### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Amplify deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Connect to AWS Amplify

1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
2. Click "New app" → "Host web app"
3. Connect to GitHub repository: `mcpmessenger/ToolTip`
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Amplify will automatically detect the `amplify.yml` configuration

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In the Amplify console, add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

#### 4. Deploy

- Amplify will automatically build and deploy when you push to main
- The build process will:
  - Install frontend dependencies
  - Build the React app
  - Deploy to AWS CDN

### 🔧 Current Configuration

**Frontend Only Deployment:**
- ✅ React app builds successfully
- ✅ Static files served via CDN
- ✅ Fallback to mock data when backend unavailable
- ✅ Responsive design works on all devices

**Backend Status:**
- ⚠️ Backend needs separate deployment (recommend AWS Lambda or EC2)
- ⚠️ TypeScript compilation issues need resolution
- ✅ API endpoints defined and ready

### 🌐 Live Features

Once deployed, users can:
- ✅ View the beautiful dashboard interface
- ✅ See demo components and UI elements
- ✅ Experience the glass card design
- ✅ Use the tooltip companion (frontend only)
- ⚠️ Web scraping features will show mock data until backend is deployed

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Frontend** (Ready now!)
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect to Amplify
   - Deploy

2. **Deploy Backend** (Future)
   - Fix TypeScript compilation issues
   - Deploy to AWS Lambda or EC2
   - Update API_BASE_URL in frontend

3. **Configure Domain** (Optional)
   - Add custom domain in Amplify
   - Set up SSL certificate

### 📊 Build Status

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Vite bundling optimized
- ✅ Static assets generated

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Amplify build logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Ensure GitHub repository is accessible
4. Check `amplify.yml` syntax

### 📞 Support

The project is now ready for AWS Amplify deployment! The frontend will work immediately, and the backend can be deployed separately when ready.
