### Current State for Library Development
- The project is a full-fledged application, not a standalone library.
- The `GlassCard` component seems to be the core UI element that could be extracted.
- AI chat, web crawling, and Supabase integration are tightly coupled within the application logic.
- The current setup requires both frontend and backend servers to run.

### Initial Thoughts for Library/Tool Development
- **Decoupling**: The AI chat, web crawling, and Supabase integration need to be decoupled from the core UI component if the goal is a simple, embeddable tooltip library.
- **Modularity**: The `GlassCard` component could be refactored into a reusable React component.
- **Configuration**: Provide clear configuration options for developers to customize appearance and behavior.
- **API**: Define a clear API for integrating the tooltip into existing websites (e.g., props for React, or a JavaScript API for vanilla JS).
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies for the core tooltip component to make it lightweight.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation will be crucial for easy adoption.
- **Distribution**: Consider packaging as an npm package.





## Research on Tooltip Libraries and Embeddable Web Components

### Popular React Tooltip Libraries:
- **Tippy.js**: Frequently mentioned as a robust and highly customizable option.
- **React-Tooltip**: Another popular choice, straightforward to use.
- **Chakra UI / Material UI / Radix Primitives**: UI libraries that include tooltip components, often used within their respective ecosystems.
- **Floating UI**: A low-level library for positioning UI elements, often used as a foundation for tooltips and popovers.

### Best Practices for Embeddable Web Components:
- **Encapsulation**: Use Shadow DOM to encapsulate styles and behavior, preventing conflicts with the host page.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the component is accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
- **Simple Interface**: Provide a clear and minimal API for integration.
- **Performance**: Optimize for small bundle size and efficient rendering.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Ideally, the component should work across different frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS).
- **Distribution**: Publish as an npm package.
- **Configuration**: Allow customization through props (for React) or attributes (for Web Components).
- **Styling**: Provide options for custom styling (CSS variables, slots, or direct CSS injection).
- **Lazy Loading**: Load the component only when needed.
- **Clear Documentation**: Essential for developer adoption.

### Considerations for ToolTip:
- The current `GlassCard` component is a React component. To make it easily embeddable on *any* website, it might be beneficial to wrap it as a Web Component or provide a vanilla JavaScript API.
- The existing AI chat, web crawling, and Supabase integrations are features of the *application*, not a generic tooltip. These should be optional or removed for a standalone tooltip library.
- The 3D glass effect is a unique visual feature that should be preserved and made configurable.
- The component currently uses Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. For an embeddable component, these styles need to be carefully encapsulated to avoid conflicting with the host website's styles.
