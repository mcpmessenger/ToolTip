# 🔄 Quick Reload Guide - See Your Auto-Precrawl Working!

## ✅ Your Extension is Working!

From your console, I can see:
- ✅ Chat widget initialized
- ✅ IndexedDB initialized for persistent caching

The CSP errors are from the website, not our extension.

---

## 🚨 Missing: Auto-Precrawl Messages

You should see these messages in console:
```
🤖 Auto-precrawling top links for instant tooltips...
🕷️ Pre-caching X links in background...
```

**If you DON'T see them → Extension needs to be reloaded!**

---

## Step-by-Step Reload

### 1. Reload the Extension
Go to: `chrome://extensions`
- Find "Tooltip Companion"
- Click the 🔄 **reload button**
- You should see it restart

### 2. Reload the Page
Press F5 or click reload in browser

### 3. Watch the Console
Press F12 → Console tab

**You should now see:**
```
✅ Tooltip Companion is active!
   Backend Service URL: http://localhost:3000
🤖 Auto-precrawling top links for instant tooltips...
🕷️ Pre-caching 20 links in background...

## What Each Message Means

### ✅ Working Messages:
- `"Chat widget initialized"` → Extension loaded
- `"IndexedDB initialized"` → Cache ready
- `"Auto-precrawling..."` → **Pre-caching started!**
- `"Pre-caching X links"` → Finding links
- `"Background precrawl started"` → Caching in background
- `"📦 IndexedDB hit"` → Tooltip served from cache (INSTANT!)

### ❌ CSP Errors (Ignore These):
These are from the WEBSITE, not our extension:
- "Refused to apply inline style" → Website CSP
- Google Tag Manager errors → Third-party scripts
- Analytics errors → Site tracking

**These don't affect our extension!**
