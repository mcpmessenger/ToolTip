## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Scenarios:**

**✅ Verified Working:**
- Gmail (personal email, links in messages)
- Reddit (post titles, comment links)
- Hacker News (article links)
- AWS Console (S3 buckets, services)
- GitHub (repo links, profile links)
- Google Drive (file links)
- Google Search results

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Hover over link → tooltip appears
2. ✅ Move mouse away → tooltip disappears
3. ✅ Hover again → cached screenshot (instant)
4. ✅ Batch precrawl → all links cached
5. ✅ Service restart → cache cleared
6. ✅ Page refresh → script cleared (expected)
7. ✅ Dynamic content (AJAX) → new links detected

## 🤝 Comparison: Console Injection vs. Custom Fork

| Feature | Console Injection | Custom Fork |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ⭐ Simple (paste script) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex (compile browser) |
| **Browser Support** | ✅ All browsers | ❌ Custom build only |
| **Stability** | ✅ Stable | ❌ Crashes (auto-injection bug) |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Easy (edit JS file) | ❌ Hard (recompile browser) |
| **Distribution** | ✅ Copy/paste | ❌ Distribute binary (100+ MB) |
| **Backend Needed** | ✅ Yes (localhost:3000) | ✅ Yes (same service) |
| **Performance** | ✅ Fast | ✅ Same |
| **User Experience** | ⚠️ Manual paste | ✅ Built-in (when working) |
| **Development Time** | ✅ Hours | ❌ Weeks |
| **Disk Space** | ✅ <100 MB | ❌ ~40 GB |

**Recommendation:** **Use Console Injection** until fork auto-injection bug is fixed.

## ✅ Conclusion

### **What Works:**
✅ Playwright service captures screenshots  
✅ Console injection displays tooltips  
✅ Caching system works perfectly  
✅ Compatible with all modern browsers  
✅ Fast, responsive, beautiful UI  
✅ Privacy-preserving (local-only)  

### **What's Required:**
📦 **Backend Service:** `playwright_service/` running on localhost:3000  
📦 **Node.js + Playwright:** For screenshot capture  
📦 **Manual Console Paste:** User must inject script per-session  

### **Deployment Model:**
```
User's Machine:
  ├─ Node.js Backend (localhost:3000) [REQUIRED]
  └─ Browser + Console Script [USER ACTION]
```

**This is a working, production-ready solution** that provides powerful link preview functionality with minimal complexity and maximum privacy.
